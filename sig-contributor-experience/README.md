# Contributor Experience SIG

Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project and growing the ecosystem. We need to ensure our contributors are happy and productive, we need to break the commit-rate ceiling we hit in July 2015, and we need to get the monotonically growing PR merge latency and numbers of open PRs and issues under control.
