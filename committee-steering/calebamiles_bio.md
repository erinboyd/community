### Problem solving style

I am a huge fan of ideas which seek to simplify and unify possibly due to my
undergraduate study of physics and mathematics. Coming from a background in
agile software development, I believe that collaboration is incredibly
important and that continuous feedback on incremental solutions are likely
to produce the best outcome. I therefore try spend a lot of time talking with
people about the problems that are important to them before stepping back to
try to introduce a minimal solution based on their concerns.

I also tend to focus on attacking systemic or structural problems because I
genuinely believe that people will try to do the right thing if they are
allowed to work within a framework designed for their success so I am always
looking for ways to reduce process friction.

### Problems that are important to me

I believe that addressing the dual challenge of communicating what everyone is
working on to other developers, and then explaining that work to users is one
of the most pressing issues for Kubernetes today.

I also believe that we need to invest in the contributor experience particularly
by better supporting new contributors, particularly new graduates and
underrepresented communities, with mentorship programs. If we are going to be a
successful and sustainable project we need to ensure that we maintain a healthy
pipeline of new contributors while at the same time reducing the workload for
more established contributors.

The Kubernetes community is incredibly talented group of engineers, technical
writers, PMs, and technologists,  however, I do believe we could work more
closely with the projects and services that we depend on. In general I would
like to see more engagement with other open source projects such as gRPC,
Protobuf, and Ginkgo to build more of our needs into their projects rather than
maintaining workarounds within Kubernetes. 

I would also like to see a much shallower on ramp for new contributors. I
believe that if you are already comfortable with Go, Git, and GitHub you should
find the project fairly easy to understand and work in. In the same way
Kubernetes contributors should find their experience is broadly applicable to
other projects using similar tooling.

Scaling contributions is another serious challenge for the project and I am very
interested in working on helping to support the effort to build a Kubernetes
release from multiple git repositories, possibly spread over multiple GitHub
organizations. While the effort should be driven by SIG Release moving from a
monorepo will be an enormous lift that will require the continued attention of
the Steering Committee at least until a roadmap is agreed to by the SIGs.

### Roles held

I joined the community through my employer, CoreOS, in 2016 since then I have
made shallow contributions to

- SIG Contributor Experience
- SIG Release
- SIG PM
- SIG Testing

as well as serving in a minor capacity in the 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 releases. I
currently help to facilitate

- SIG PM, co lead and co founder
- SIG Release, co lead and co founder

I am also slowly trying to work on a proposal to adopt a process for proposing
changes that is similar to the Rust RFC or Python PEP process.
