### The way I think

I have been described as a linear, and engineer minded thinker.
My thought patterns typically involve detecting high level patterns, and then looking at different implementations of the pattern.
I have been engineering for over 10 years, and think very much like an engineer.

### The way I solve problems

Problems are fun and exciting, and not always bad.
A problem could be something minor like dealing with a splinter, or a sun burn.
Or fairly more complex like moving kubernetes projects out of the main repository.
Regardless of the complexity, problems are not necessarily bad.
I love detecting problems, and finding exciting new ways to engineer effective solutions.

I am constantly examining the world around me, and trying to find new ways of making life easier. 
This is both a blessing and a curse, as sometimes I can not stop looking for ways to improve something.

1. I first detect the space that needs attention. 
2. I then look at a hypothetical future space that might be "better" in some set of ways.
3. I look for ways the new hypothetical future might have weaknesses.
4. I look at at least 1 possible way to solution towards the new hypothetical future.

After engineering for many years I have learned that the plan almost never executes as intended.
True problem solving skill sets are tested and found in the small spaces in between your plan. 
This is where I excel as a problem solver.


### What is important to me

Mental, philosophical, and design diversity. Period.

I truly believe that the best teams and projects are those that embrace new ways of thinking.

Having a leadership board of people who all think the same way, and all are moving in the right direction is stale and stagnant.

 - I would like to be in a position where I can advocate for ideas that might go against the grain. 
 - I would like to be in a position where I can help foster diversity in Kubernetes in both our design process, but also our goals and philosophies.
 - I would like to be in a position where I can encourage my peers to put themselves into hard, or testing situations in order to help grow and mature.
 - I would like to be in a position where I can let others know that it's okay to try something and fail as we all learn as a scientific community.
 

### Work in the community

 - I spend as much of my free time as humanly possible contributing to Kubernetes. 
 - I take impromptu video calls with total strangers just to explain how the control plane works.
 - I helped run *sig-aws* even though it risked conflicting with my job at Microsoft.
 - I spend time at conferences meeting with people to overcome language barriers and get them involved in the project.
 - I created [kubicorn](https://github.com/kris-nova/kubicorn) in my free time and it has been reviewed as one of the best open source projects to contribute to in the space.
 
I am in over 30 slack channels, and have a presence in almost all of them. I truly love our community, and rely on it as much as anyone.

# Why you should vote for me

### 1) I obsess over things. 

If I set my mind to something, I will get it done. I climb mountains because I am afraid of them. I write code because it's hard. I stand up for what I beleieve in because no one else will.

And I don't stop. Ever.

### 2) I think differently.

I have engineered on both sides of the gender spectrum both as a male and as a female. 
I learned invaluable lessons in solving problems, keeping myself happy, and working effectively witth my peers on either side.
Furthermore I am not afraid to ask *why*.. I think it's healthy to question our systems and to understand why something was built they way it was.

### 3) I speak for the software.

At the end of the day, my concerns are very much in alignment with **what is best for the software**. 
My work in Kubernetes started because I love the philosophies and ideas behind the software.
The fact that my career happens to (sometimes) align with my work in the project is just a bonus.

I truly want the project to be successful regardless of what companies are involved, and I think the first steps in making that happen is to focus on writing clean, quality, approachable code.
