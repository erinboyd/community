# Kubernetes Community Office Hours

Office Hours is a live stream where we answer live questions about Kubernetes from users on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KubernetesCommunity/).

### When and Where

Third Wednesday of every month, there are two sessions: 

- European Edition: [1pm UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Kubernetes+Office+Hours+%28EU+Edition%29&iso=20171018T13)

Tune into the [Kubernetes YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KubernetesCommunity/live) to follow along.
