# Overview

We have an oncall rotation in the SIG. The role description is as follows:

* Ensure that the testgrid (https://k8s-testgrid.appspot.com/sig-federation) is green. This person will be the point of contact if testgrid turns red. Will identify the problem and fix it (most common scenarios: find culprit PR and revert it or free quota by deleting leaked resources).
Will also report most common failure scenarios and suggest improvements. Its up to the sig or individuals to prioritize and take up those tasks.
